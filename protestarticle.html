The Smithsonian Metro stop was at a standstill on the afternoon of April 5 as thousands of people poured onto the National Mall to partake in the “Hands Off” protest in Washington D.C. The protest was a conglomerate effort by many organizations to speak out against Donald Trump’s overreach of power and the government involvement of figures like Elon Musk. 

The protest is the product of many Americans' dissatisfaction with Trump’s actions and executive orders since returning to the oval office this year. 

“They’re dismantling our country. They’re looting our government. And they think we’ll just watch,” according to the official Hands Off Website.

“Donald Trump and Elon Musk think this country belongs to them. They're taking everything they can get their hands on, and daring the world to stop them.”

Posters and signs throughout the crowds boasted disdain for things like social security and medicaid cuts, DOGE and attacks on immigrant populations and the LGBTQ+ community. There were strong themes of “stopping the steal” throughout.

The protest was centralized around the Washington monument and the large crowd packed the surrounding lawn. A group of protestors marched circles directly around the Washington Monument, vigorously shouting and chanting. Others gathered in smaller groups throughout the crowd playing music and chanting in a more upbeat manner. On the South side of the monument, a large crowd gathered to listen to speakers on the Sylvan Theater stage. The majority of protestors sat or stood around talking between themselves or simply holding up their signs. 

Organizers of the event believe the number of protestors was at least 20,000. Of note to some was the interesting, and perhaps surprising, demographics of the turnout. There was a significantly large amount of older white adults. Although they turned up in numbers, and carried powerful signs, the protest notably lacked energy to some.

“People had fantastic signs, but it was very quiet,” said protestor Lita Talisman. 

“In the past, I've enjoyed the energy and vigor at protests. It felt like we were all just hanging out in the same space with signs rather than protesting.”

The protest was entirely peaceful, there was an air of calm and most protestors seemed upbeat and cheerful. Many people came with friends or brought and involved their children as well.

“I was amazed to see how healing and joyful such an event could be even though it was born out of frustration,” said protestor Leah Webster, a teacher in Virginia feeling the personal impact of the executive orders on education. 

“People are clearly angry, but that {has} allowed for blossoms in creativity, building of community, and connections with the people who also were impassioned enough to join.”
	
The protest was one of about 1,300 that occurred across every U.S. state on April 5. The movement organizers dubbed the date a “national day of action” and estimated millions of people participated in total. The hope of organizers is that the public outcry will raise awareness and cause lawmakers to act on the perceived administration’s overreach. 

The abuse of power has been characterized by extreme cuts to government workforces, implementation of global tariffs and the creation of DOGE. Changes to social security, immigration policies, elimination of DEI programs and cuts to environmental funding are also fueling the movement. 

Trump’s inclusion of wealthy elites, mainly Elon Musk, into government processes has been a major source of the public outcry. Supporters of the movement view these actions and policies as an illegal takeover being perpetrated by billionaires. They believe the goal is to line the pockets of the rich while average working class citizens suffer the consequences. 

Participants on Saturday resonated with these beliefs and concerns. They were hopeful that the protest and broader movement will raise awareness of these severe problems and invoke change by officials.  

“More than anything, I'm hopeful it will encourage others to join the movement until we are so loud that we can't be ignored,"said Webster.

“Politicians are supposed to act for the people, so if they see that the people are outraged, then they may do more to help us.”

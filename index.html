<div class="aboutmepar" ><p>Hi! My name is Erin and I am a rising senior at George Washington University studying Journalism and Mass Communication. My journalistic passions are social justice reporting and travel writing. I also have an interest in documentary film and would love to apply this to both of these passions in my future work!</p> 
<p>I am currently an investigative journalism & digital storytelling intern with The Innocent Convicts, an organization that works to shed light on cases of wrongful conviction in the US and advocate for victims of injustice. In this position I conduct research, write in depth reports and contribute to campaign projects.

<h2 style="text-align:center;" >Groceries and Goodwill: The Work of Alicia Kiyvyra</h2>
    <h3 style="text-align:center;" >12/16/2024</h3>
<div class="storytext" >
  <p>Drive around the back of any grocery store in Washington or past any school in Ward 8 and there's a chance you might see a van chalked full of food driven by a spirited and passionate woman.</p>
<p>Alicia Kiyvyra is the cofounder and “head project wrangler” of To Be Well Fed. To Be Well Fed is a nonprofit organization that works to limit food scarcity for families in need while also limiting waste. Kiyvyra is a dedicated and zealous woman who has built an organization with a massive impact. 
</p>
<p>“She is incredibly powerful and brings so much energy and enthusiasm to everything she does. She doesn't do things half-assed, she's all in,” said her husband, Dave Kiyvyra.
</p>
<p>Kiyvyra and her husband founded To Be Well Fed in 2017. The goal of the organization is to help feed children in Ward 8 of Washington, where he works in the school system. They specifically focus on making sure students arrive at school everyday well fed and ready to learn</p>
<p>Ward 8 has a population that is predominantly low income and African American. According to the Smithsonian Anacostia Community Museum, 99 percent of children in Ward 8 schools are in the free and reduced lunch program and 14 percent are homeless. Ward 8 also has significantly less access to fresh food. There is one full service grocery store for every 85,360 residents. This is a sharp contrast to the other side of the city where large, wealthy white neighborhoods like Ward 3 have one full service grocery store for every 9,336 residents. 
</p>
<p>Kiyvyra and her family live on the wealthier side of the city, she acknowledges this privilege and sees it as an opportunity given to her to help others who do not have access to the same quality food. 
</p>
<p>“I hate to think there are hungry kids and families in my city where insanely wealthy folks have so much and just across the river there is very very little,” said Kiyvyra.
</p>
  <p>Growing up, Kiyvyra watched her grandfather collect expiring food from stores and hand it out to people in need in their community. When Kiyvyra’s husband suggested they start collecting food for the kids at his schools, she was all in.Since then, To Be Well Fed has become a full time hustle for Kiyvyra, who does all of the planning and coordinating for the organization. As well as the majority of the donation pickups and deliveries. 
</p>
  <p> “She does the physical work of To Be Well Fed six days a week, but thinks about it all seven,” said Dave, who lovingly refers to her as “Hurricane Alicia”.
</p>
  <p>With Kiyvyra at the helm, To Be Well Fed grew into a larger and larger operation. It expanded to help students at more schools and began sending home more meals for the children. Kiyvyra does all of the grunt work and heavy lifting herself, both figuratively and literally. She is the one who picks up all the food donations, organizes them for the families and then distributes them at the schools.
</p>
  <p>Originally Kiyvyra and her family would purchase food at Costco to distribute, however the game really changed when they began “rescuing” food instead. Kiyvyra works with grocery stores and farmers markets on the wealthier sides of town to collect, or “rescue”, their high quality and fresh food that would otherwise be thrown away.. This is important to Kiyvyra’s desire to be more sustainable and help the environment.
</p>
  <p>“There are hungry people everywhere and at the same time we have an insane excess of food waste, and these two problems can actually help each other,” said Kiyvyra.
</p>
  <p>Since starting this process, To Be Well Fed is able to provide weekly groceries for not only students, but their entire families. They currently feed 300 families across three schools in the ward every week, all on the back of Kiyvyra’s dedication and hard work.
</p>
  <p>Something else very important to her is that these families are provided high quality and healthy food that actually tastes good. It is clear when you see these families receiving the food that they are very grateful to not just have food, but have quality food.</p>
<p>“Alicia and her people are just great, the food she brings us, it's actually really good and we can actually cook good stuff with it,” said one Ward 8 mom picking up her groceries.
</p>
  <p>“I'm glad I can provide my kids with actual healthy choices,” said another parent.</p>
  <p>Kiyvyra treats everyone who works with her or receives her aid with dignity, respect and love. She has built clear rapport with many of them and always has a smile across her face when around others. She is evidently a person in the right field meant to be doing this type of work</p>
  <p>Kiyvyra has always had passions for service and has lived her life accordingly. Growing up she knew she wanted to be in the Peace Corps. After getting a bachelor's degree in agronomy she became a volunteer in Paraguay. There she worked with small rural farming communities to help them develop sustainability practices and diversify their crops.</p>
 <p>Kiyvyra speaks very fondly of this time and the effect it had on her life. She credits it for inspiring her to go to graduate school, where she got a masters degree in agroforestry. After this she also earned a doctorate in forest engineering. A lot of her sustainability efforts and desires to help the environment stem from this time and education.
</p> 
<p>Kiyvyra also credits the experience for inspiring her to adopt her children. She is a mother to three wonderful boys and takes pride in raising them to be people who are aware of and contribute to the world in which they live. Ever since they were young, she has included them in the work she does with To Be Well Fed. They often tag along with her on drives and help out with food pickups and organization.
</p>
<p>“I think it's important for my kids to think about their community and be aware that there are problems in our world and that we can work to solve those problems,” said Kiyvyra.</p>
<p>“Sometimes the solution is simple, and sometimes it isn't. But it is essential to serve your community and to be a participating member of it and not just in it,” she continued.</p>
<p>She hopes that they will continue to be interested in the work and says she will always encourage them to keep their eyes open and help their community in one way or another in the future. 
</p>
<p>As far as Kiyvyra’s future, she has high hopes for To Be Well Fed moving forward and doesn't plan on slowing down anytime soon. She gets emails from more schools every week asking for help, but she is at maximum capacity with just herself and her van. Her solution? A bigger van! Which is hopefully soon to come, and bring with it more opportunities, more volunteers and more positive impact.
</p>
  <p>“I hope to sustainably increase our impact: make more connections and rescue more food so we can feed more kids and their families,” said Kiyvyra.</p>
